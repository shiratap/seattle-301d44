# Class 02: Responsive Web Design

## Overview

Today's videos primarily cover CSS layout topics. They are uploaded and the corresponding demo code is in this directory.

We will also have a video that discusses the basics of pattern matching with regular expressions, including the introduction of several online validation tools. That video will be recorded and uploaded after our online meeting.

Presenting this course content in videos opens a lot of space in our Wednesday and Thursday lectures on campus for Q&A and mop-up. We should get to the end of Week 1 in solid shape despite the two remote days we've had.

## Plan for our online meeting

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Q&A
