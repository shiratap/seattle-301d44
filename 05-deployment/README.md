# Class 5: Deployment Workshop 

## Overview

Today we will cover code deployments.

Following lecture, we will deploy our portfolio app, workshop style. Each student will follow along, deploying the personal portfolio built earlier this week to a cloud web hosting platform called Heroku.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Depoyment Overview and Demo
- Deployment Workshop
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 5 of Code 301, students will:
- Understand the difference between deploying static and dynamic web applications
- Understand deployment processes over multiple environments
- Be able to deploy dynamic web applications to Heroku

## Node.js
* A real JavaScript environment!
* npm -- node application/package manager and bundler

## Building a web server with Node and Express.js
* Handling multiple requests from clients
* Sending data back in multiple formats

## Deployments
* Historically: FTP and direct server access, uploading changes immediately and directly
  * In many smaller shops, this is still the way!
* Deployment: Moving code from development into a production environment
* With source control tools (`git`, direct integrations, and pipleine scripting `bamboo`) we can more safely control what goes out, where it goes, and when it happens.
* Environments: Most companies have multiple environments where code can be deployed to.  Code changes less frequently and the stability of the codebase is less volatile as you get closer to production.
  * Local: Developer Workstations/Laptops
  * Dev: Shared environment where developers release code frequently for integration testing
  * Stage: Pre-Production environment that generally exists for Product/Business to do feature analysis and review
  * UAT: User Acceptance Testing environment is typically where the client and end users get a final look at the state of the app before it goes live.
  * A/B/C: Hot-Swappable production environments where the code is actually "Live"
    * C (passive): The most recent "good" release
    * B (standby): The current release, but not active
    * A (active): The current release, live to the world


#### Heroku Deployment Reference:

- `git remote -v`  (verify your git remotes)
- `heroku create [appname]`  (create the app on Heroku and set remote)
    - Or, `heroku git:remote -a [appname]` (for a previously created heroku app)
- `git remote -v` (see that heroku is now a remote)
- `git push heroku master` (deploy from master)
  - `git push heroku [branch]:master` (deploy from a non-master branch to Heroku)
